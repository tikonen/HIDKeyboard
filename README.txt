This project mimics Apple Aluminium keyboard and sends Brightness Up/Down keypresses on board user button 1 and 2 presses.

The 'Keyboard' can be used in iMac Display Target Mode to control brightness if keyboard buttons do not work (e.g. when it's a Bluetooth or some 3rdparty keyboard)

Project is generated for System Workbench for STM32 IDE and STM32F401VE microcontroller. Code assumes STEVAL-MKI109V3 board circuits (USB D+, Buttons, ..).
